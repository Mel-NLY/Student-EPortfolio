# Student-EPortfolio
WEB Development Module

Using (Active Server Page Extended) <b>ASPX</b> to create webpages that are generated by web servers running on the Microsoft ASP.NET framework. In this module, we have learnt to write scripts using C# code that would be processed by the web server and converted into HTML code. These ASPX files that contain scripts and source codes, help communicate to the yusers browser on how a web page should be opened and displayed.

In this WEB Development Module Assignment, we were tasked to create an online platform for students to add their projects and showcase them. We would have to build it using the concepts that we have learnt, POST Requests, API Requests and many others.
